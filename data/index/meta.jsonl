I went for medical check up two weeks ago and I was told I’m gradually having the tendency of a high BP due to in-depth thinking. I was asked what would have caused my sudden increase in BP but I couldn’t say it out. I’ve been worried lately cause I noticed some strange behavior exhibited by my husband as he keeps late night and he’s always clingy to his phone even in the toilets. This is a crazy feeling which I’m uncomfortable about and anytime I tried talking to him about it he denies it with an outburst of anger. This was too much for me so I started searching the internet for the best, reliable and secured way to remotely monitor his phone activities. Luckily for me I found 5ISPYHAK437@GMAIL.COM then I hired this tech guru. He requested for few info which I gave him, within few hours he sent me a remote access link to watch all of his phone activities it was as if I got his phone in my palm. Then I got him caught redhanded in his cheating ways, I figured he’s been seeing a lady downtown. I confronted him with this evidences and he couldn’t deny it as he was shocked how I got to know about his actions. I’m grateful I found out before it’s too late and I finally got my peace of mind restored.

I found out when my friend and I jokingly got a hacker called 5ISPYHAK to spy on our wives’ phones. There were no signs at all of her infidelity so I was 100% sure that I wouldn’t get anything suspicious in her phone. On the other hand, my friend had doubts based on his wife’s recent behaviour. We got a cyber company called 5ISPYHAK to do the job and they immediately sent us instructions which later gave us access to the women’s phones. The shock I felt when I checked her WhatsApp and messages is hard to describe. My wife is the sweetest and most caring woman on earth and there was no way I would ever imagine her hurting me in any way. But surprisingly, she had been sleeping with our son’s coach for what seemed like months. I ambushed her and her defence was that she got lonely because I no longer give her attention and affection but the truth is that I have been occupied with work since I am the breadwinner. I somehow understand her but at the same time I feel no emotion. I love my family and I don’t want us to go through the agony of divorce but i just have to for my own peace of mind.
